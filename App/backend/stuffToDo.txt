Web sockets for chat mechanism
Engage a user in a web socket whenever they connect to a channel

http request on loading chat
websocket connection when connected to a channel/chat

on frontend when a user sends a friend request, it'll add the user that sent the request to that person's receivedFriendRequest list
and also add that user that sent the request to their own sentFriendRequest list

whenever the person accepts the request, delete the user that sent the request from the person's receivedFriendRequest list,
and remove that user that sent the request from their own sentFriendRequest list.
finally add each other person to their own friends list.

if the person denied the request do the same stuff but don't add each other person to their own friends list.

maybe add info to friend list like became friends on this data

instead of writing all that decode shit you can just use the authenticate middleware and pass the user id and username to the next() function

fix the patch method of user

search all users and return just username, real name
change user schema to just have realname instead of 2 fields

work on event schema and routes

put hobbies on the hobby schema

//
maybe for each event you can post pictures to that event, so like a subreddit with pics of event, posted by both owner and users
with comments (extra prolly not)

paginate the events by showing the most recent timeOfEvent (or that is actually kind of a bad idea, so just do it by createdAt timestamp)

for the dateAndTimeOfEvent have on the frontend a calender for it


// future ideas of project
bottoms tabs are home, map, search, chat, profile
home is more of less what we got going on and the same with map
just more hobbies based and display locations based on hobbies and shit like that
//

group hobbies based on type of hobby,
so each type has a list of hobbies associated with it,
just use chatgpt for this shit

make endpoint for profile page tab of frontend

or maybe its best to have 1 single endpoint that gives a user's profile information, hobbies, events, friends,
so on refresh its just the whole shibang
